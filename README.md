# Bristlecone Markdown

WordPress plugin by [Bristlecone IT Services](https://bristleconeit.com). Write in Markdown without Jetpack, with syntax aligned to iA Writer.

Plugin homepage: [https://bristleconeit.com/bristlecone-markdown](https://bristleconeit.com/bristlecone-markdown).

Development repository: [https://github.com/Zyniker13/bits-wp-markdown](https://github.com/Zyniker13/bits-wp-markdown).

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.4+
- PHP 8.3+

## Development

```bash
composer install
composer test
```

The Gutenberg block is plain `wp.*` JavaScript (no build step). Editor writing-surface craft notes: `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, `docs/impeccable.md`.

## WordPress.org

This directory is the plugin root. `readme.txt` is the file WordPress.org uses. The directory contributor is `bristleconeit` (Bristlecone IT Services). Plugin URI is `https://bristleconeit.com/bristlecone-markdown`; Author URI is `https://bristleconeit.com`.

Do not include Jetpack in directory tags.

WordPress.org assets (icon, banner, screenshots) belong in the plugin’s SVN `/assets` directory after approval, not in this zip.

Plugin settings are at **Bristlecone → Markdown** (`admin.php?page=bristlecone-markdown`). Older bookmarks under Settings (`options-general.php?page=bristlecone-markdown`) redirect there. The Bristlecone parent menu is shared with Bristlecone Admin Styles when that plugin is active.

The public plugin page is `https://bristleconeit.com/bristlecone-markdown`. Copy and standards notes for that page live in `docs/plugin-home.md` (not shipped in the WordPress.org zip).

## Storage

Document-mode posts (Classic Editor, REST API, iA Writer) store HTML in `post_content` and Markdown in `post_content_filtered`, with `_bristlecone_markdown` (legacy `_bits_markdown` is still recognized; Jetpack’s `_wpcom_is_markdown` and `_wpcom_markdown` are also honored). The Markdown block keeps source in block attributes and saves HTML as a fallback if the plugin is deactivated. Existing `jetpack/markdown` blocks are adopted when Jetpack Markdown is inactive and converted to `bristlecone/markdown` on save (optional bulk converter under Tools, off by default). The same alias path covers `simple-markdown/markdown-block` (`content`) when that plugin is inactive, plus optional custom identifiers (`namespace/block-name|attribute`). A gated Tools scanner can list other unregistered blocks whose names contain “markdown” for review; it does not auto-register aliases.

## Footnotes

Footnote IDs are namespaced as `bristlecone-markdown-fn-{postId}-…` so archive pages and WordPress’s core Footnotes block are less likely to collide. New posts are converted a second time after insert so those IDs use the real post ID rather than a placeholder.

`wpautop` is disabled for document-mode Markdown posts because it can scramble footnote markup. Themes that restyle `sup` may still need a small CSS tweak. Footnote lists still appear on archives for every excerpted/full post that contains them. Inline footnotes (`[^text with spaces.]`) work alongside named `[^1]` definitions. The core Footnotes block is a separate feature; IDs do not overlap, but a post could contain both.

## Content Blocks

iA Writer Content Blocks transclude files from a local library WordPress cannot access. Compile the document in iA Writer (or publish the already-expanded Markdown) rather than expecting WordPress to resolve those paths.

## Release zip

Build a production zip (single root folder `bristlecone-markdown`, Composer `--no-dev`):

```bash
composer release
```

The zip is written to `dist/bristlecone-markdown-{version}.zip`, using the version in the plugin header. Upload that file at [Add Your Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/developers/add/). After approval, tag updates go through WordPress.org SVN; this GitHub repository stays the development tree.
