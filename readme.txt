Write in Markdown without Jetpack. Block editor, Classic Editor, comments, and iA Writer publishing, with iA Writer-aligned syntax.

== Description ==

Bristlecone Markdown lets you write WordPress content in Markdown and keep the source for later edits. It is a self-contained replacement for Jetpack’s Markdown features, and its syntax is aligned with [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) (Markdown support only, not the rest of the iA Writer app).

The plugin is developed by [Bristlecone IT Services](https://bristleconeit.com). Plugin homepage: [bristleconeit.com/bristlecone-markdown](https://bristleconeit.com/bristlecone-markdown). Source and issues are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Zyniker13/bits-wp-markdown).

= Writing surfaces =

* **Markdown block** in the block editor, with a typography-first empty state, source, and preview
* **Optional Markdown-first editor** (off by default): new posts start with a Markdown block, and new blocks prefer Markdown instead of a paragraph
* **Whole-document Markdown** for the Classic Editor, the REST API, and iA Writer’s Publish command
* **Comment Markdown**, enabled separately

HTML is stored in `post_content` (and in the block’s saved markup). The Markdown source is kept in `post_content_filtered` for document-mode posts, so the site still displays if you deactivate the plugin.

= Syntax =

CommonMark plus:

* Strikethrough `~~text~~`
* Highlight `==text==`
* Tables
* Footnotes `[^1]` and iA Writer inline footnotes `[^this is the note.]`
* Heading permalinks and cross-references (`[Heading][]`, optional `{#id}` / `[Label]` on headings; permalinks do not show a `#` glyph)
* Table of contents placeholder `{{TOC}}`
* YAML front matter and `[%key]` interpolation
* `$inline$` and `$$block$$` math (KaTeX, loaded only when needed)
* Superscript `^2` / `y^(a+b)^` and subscript `x~z`
* Page break `+++`
* Unpublished `//` comments (stripped from output)
* MultiMarkdown-style citations `[p. 23][#CiteKey]`
* Safe inline HTML

Fenced code blocks can be highlighted on the server (no extra JavaScript). Theme developers can override `.hljs` or dequeue `bristlecone-markdown-highlight`.

= Jetpack Markdown =

If Jetpack Markdown is still active, Bristlecone Markdown **does not** convert posts or comments, so content is not processed twice. An admin notice offers a one-click control to disable the Jetpack Markdown module. Existing Jetpack Markdown posts (`_wpcom_is_markdown` or `_wpcom_markdown`, plus `post_content_filtered`) are adopted automatically afterward.

When that module is off, existing `jetpack/markdown` Gutenberg blocks stay editable (they are not treated as missing blocks). Saving a post rewrites them to `bristlecone/markdown`. The inserter still offers only the Bristlecone Markdown block. An optional Tools converter can rewrite every matching post at once; it is off by default and requires Bristlecone → Markdown → “Enable Jetpack Markdown block converter under Tools”, then Tools → Bristlecone Markdown Converter, then a confirmation checkbox.

= Other Markdown blocks =

This plugin does **not** replace every Markdown plugin. It can adopt a few Gutenberg block names so existing posts stay editable:

* `simple-markdown/markdown-block` (attribute `content`) when that plugin is not already registering the block
* Custom identifiers under Bristlecone → Markdown (Advanced): one `namespace/block-name|attribute` per line (for example `acme/markdown|content`). If `|attribute` is omitted, Bristlecone tries `source`, then `content`, then `markdown`

Aliases are hidden from the inserter and convert on save. The same Tools checkbox unlocks a scanner that lists unregistered block names containing “markdown” for review. Nothing is rewritten or added to the custom list until you select names and confirm. Names that look like editor comments (for example `markdown-comment`) are flagged and left unchecked.

= iA Writer =

In iA Writer you can publish drafts to WordPress 5.6+ over the REST API as Markdown. Bristlecone Markdown converts that body on save and returns Markdown source to non-Gutenberg clients on edit.

YAML keys such as `title`, `excerpt`, `tags`, `categories`, and `slug` are mapped onto the WordPress post when present. If `title` is applied to an auto-draft and `slug` is omitted, the permalink is generated from the title. Other keys are stored and available for `[%key]` interpolation.

= Intentionally not converted =

* **Task lists** (`- [ ]`) — local writing aid; skip on publish
* **Content Blocks / file transclusion** — these depend on iA Writer’s local library. WordPress cannot see that library. Compile or export the transcluded document in iA Writer before publishing.

= Footnotes =

Footnote IDs are namespaced with the post ID (`bristlecone-markdown-fn-{id}-…`) so archives and the core Footnotes block are less likely to clash. New posts are converted again after insert so those IDs are not left as a placeholder. Footnote markup can still be sensitive to theme CSS and to `wpautop` on classic (non-block) content; we disable `wpautop` for document-mode Markdown posts. If a theme styles `sup` unusually, footnotes may need a CSS tweak. Footnote lists still render on archive views for each post that contains them.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `bristlecone-markdown` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install the zip from Plugins → Add New.
2. Activate **Bristlecone Markdown**.
3. Open Bristlecone → Markdown to choose post types, comments, code highlighting, math, and whether new block-editor posts should start in Markdown. (Saved bookmarks to Settings → Bristlecone Markdown / `options-general.php?page=bristlecone-markdown` redirect to the new page.)
4. If Jetpack is installed, disable Jetpack Markdown when prompted.
5. Optional: to rewrite every `jetpack/markdown` block in the database, enable the Tools converter in settings, then confirm the run under Tools → Bristlecone Markdown Converter. The same page can convert Simple Markdown / custom identifiers and, after a scan and review, other unregistered blocks whose names contain “markdown”.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will my posts break if I deactivate the plugin? =

Published HTML remains in `post_content`. Document-mode posts continue to display. You will not be able to edit them as Markdown until the plugin is active again.

= Can I use this with the block editor and Classic Editor together? =

Yes. Mixed Gutenberg posts should use the Markdown block. Classic / REST / iA Writer posts are converted as a whole document.

= Can Markdown be the default in the block editor? =

Yes, optionally. Enable “Default to Markdown for new posts and pages” under Bristlecone → Markdown. New posts of the enabled types that use the block editor then start with a Markdown block, and inserting a new block prefers Markdown instead of a paragraph. Existing content is not rewritten. The Classic Editor is unchanged. The setting is off by default.

= What happens to existing Jetpack Markdown blocks? =

When Jetpack Markdown is off, existing `jetpack/markdown` blocks open in the editor (no missing-block warning) and are rewritten to Bristlecone Markdown when you save. The inserter still only offers the Bristlecone Markdown block. A bulk converter under Tools is optional and off by default: enable it in settings, then confirm the run on the Tools page.

= What about Simple Markdown or other Markdown blocks? =

`simple-markdown/markdown-block` is treated like Jetpack when that plugin is not registering the block (`content` maps to Bristlecone `markdown`). You can list other block names under Bristlecone → Markdown (Advanced). The Tools scanner can find unregistered blocks whose names contain “markdown”; you choose which to convert. This is compatibility for leftover Gutenberg markup, not a replacement for those plugins.

= Does this phone home? =

No. KaTeX and the highlighter are bundled. There is no tracking and no remote conversion API.

= Why do headings still show a # after updating to 1.2.0? =

New previews and new saves omit the permalink `#` glyph. HTML already stored in the post is not rewritten until you save the post again (or reconvert from Markdown source).

== Screenshots ==

1. Settings screen for Bristlecone Markdown.
2. Markdown block in the editor with source and preview.
3. A published Markdown post on the front end.

== Changelog ==

= 1.3.1 =
* Security: titles and excerpts set from YAML front matter are now saved as plain text, so markup in front matter cannot reach the page title or excerpt when another user saves the post.
* Backslashes in Markdown source (for example LaTeX such as `\frac` or escaped `\*`) are no longer dropped when a new post is saved or a revision is restored.
* Saving a Markdown post without changing its content (bulk edit, importers, or other plugins updating the post) no longer replaces the Markdown source with HTML.

= 1.3.0 =
* Settings live under the shared Bristlecone admin menu (Bristlecone → Markdown) instead of Settings → Bristlecone Markdown. The same parent is reused when Bristlecone Admin Styles is active; this plugin creates it when standing alone.
* Bookmarks to `options-general.php?page=bristlecone-markdown` redirect to `admin.php?page=bristlecone-markdown`.

= 1.2.0 =
* Block editor writing surface: empty blocks show “Write your _Markdown_ **here**…” with no boxed textarea. Source uses a borderless PlainText field (monospace). Unselected blocks with content show the server preview.
* Heading permalinks no longer insert a visible `#` before heading text. Ids and permalink anchors remain. Already-published HTML keeps the old `#` until the post is re-saved or reconverted from Markdown source.

= 1.1.1 =
* Recognize Jetpack document Markdown posts that only have `_wpcom_is_markdown` set (the meta Jetpack actually writes). Those posts now open as Markdown source after Jetpack Markdown is turned off. `_wpcom_markdown` is still recognized.

= 1.1.0 =
* Optional setting to default the block editor to Markdown: new posts and pages start with a Markdown block, and new blocks prefer Markdown instead of a paragraph. Off by default; existing content and the Classic Editor are unchanged.

= 1.0.2 =
* Adopt `simple-markdown/markdown-block` (attribute `content`) the same way as Jetpack when that plugin is inactive.
* Advanced settings: custom block identifiers (`namespace/block-name|attribute`), with source/content/markdown fallback when the attribute is omitted.
* Gated Tools scanner lists unregistered blocks whose names contain “markdown” for review→convert. Regex never auto-registers aliases. False friends such as `markdown-comment` are warned and left unchecked.

= 1.0.1 =
* Adopt existing `jetpack/markdown` Gutenberg blocks when Jetpack Markdown is inactive (hidden from the inserter; saved as `bristlecone/markdown`).
* Optional Tools converter (off by default) to rewrite those blocks site-wide after a settings checkbox and a confirmation step.

= 1.0.0 =
* Initial public release.
* Markdown block in the block editor, with source and preview tabs that use the same PHP parser as publish.
* Whole-document Markdown for the Classic Editor, the REST API, and iA Writer’s Publish command.
* Optional Markdown in comments.
* iA Writer-aligned extras: highlight, footnotes, heading permalinks and cross-references, table of contents, YAML front matter, math (KaTeX), super/subscript, page breaks, unpublished comments, and citations.
* Server-side highlighting for fenced code blocks (no extra JavaScript).
* Jetpack Markdown coexistence: skip conversion while that module is active, then adopt existing Markdown posts.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.3.1 =
Security and data-safety fix for front matter titles, backslashes in Markdown source, and bulk edits. Recommended for all sites.

= 1.3.0 =
Settings moved to Bristlecone → Markdown. Old Settings bookmarks redirect to the new page.

= 1.2.0 =
Editor writing-surface refresh, plus heading permalinks without a visible `#`. Re-save Markdown posts to refresh stored heading HTML.

= 1.1.1 =
Fixes adoption of existing Jetpack Markdown documents that use `_wpcom_is_markdown`.

= 1.1.0 =
Optional Markdown-first block editor (off by default). Enable it under Bristlecone → Markdown.

= 1.0.2 =
Optional Simple Markdown and custom-block compatibility. Tools can scan other Markdown-named blocks; conversion still requires the existing settings unlock and a confirmation step.

= 1.0.1 =
Existing Jetpack Markdown blocks are editable without Jetpack. Saving converts them to Bristlecone Markdown. Bulk rewrite is opt-in under Settings and Tools.

= 1.0.0 =
Initial public release of Bristlecone Markdown.
